This Project detects objects in the vicinity of Ultrasonic Sensor, if the object/car is under a specified distance as in the code
then the servo motor rotates it's arm by 90 degrees and stays in that position and then returns back to  the previous position.
Thus resembling the parking systems as found near tolls etc.
Changing the mechanism with no changes in the code can be made into a smartbin project as well which opens the lid when the garbage is detected.
